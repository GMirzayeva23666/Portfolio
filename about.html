                    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>
    Hi! I am Gulay Mirzayeva, currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology at ADA University. I am a student exploring web development, programming, and information systems, and this website was created as part of the SITE 1101 course.
</p>
<p>
    I was admitted to ADA University after scoring 666.7 points on the DIM exam. I have successfully completed the EAPP (English for Academic and Professional Purposes) program at ADA University, which helped me develop strong academic writing and communication skills.
</p>
<p>
    My skills include programming and analytical abilities as well as communication and academic competencies. I have experience with Python, basic C++, writing algorithms, and working with Excel. I also have skills in public speaking and academic writing. I enjoy mathematics and problem-solving, which motivates my interest in technology and logical thinking.
</p>
<p>
    In my free time, I enjoy reading books and watching movies. I am an active member of the ADA CineMates Club and the ADA Book Club, where I engage in discussions and collaborative activities with other students.
</p>
<p>
    This website presents two main projects. One project focused on the construction and understanding of logic gates such as NOT, AND, OR, NAND, and XOR. The second project, called Hour of AI, aimed to raise awareness about artificial intelligence by introducing basic AI concepts to a community with limited access to technology. In addition, this website also includes my public speaking presentation, which demonstrates my communication skills and academic development.
